      <h1>Q&A</h1>
      <div class="qa-pair">
        <h3>Q: WHAT IS PARALLAX PARADOX?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Parallax Paradox is a first person puzzle game set in a mysterious
          museum that seems oddly familiar to you. Perspectives shift in unusual
          ways. Is it a dream? Who knows. Escape and just maybe you can uncover
          the mysteries behind these exhibits.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="qa-pair">
        <h3>Q: WHAT PLATFORM IS IT BUILT FOR?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Parallax Paradox is built for Windows, because that’s where our
          illusions behave themselves… mostly. Other platforms will just have to
          keep dreaming for now.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="qa-pair">
        <h3>Q: WHERE CAN I DOWNLOAD IT?</h3>
        <p>
          A: See that big “Download Instructions” button on the home page?
          That’s not decorative. Click it, follow the steps, and the dream is
          yours.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="qa-pair">
        <h3>Q: WHAT INSPIRED PARALLAX PARADOX?</h3>
        <p>
          A: We took the mind-warping puzzles of Superliminal & Antichamber,
          sprinkled in a dash of Portal, threw in some cel-shaded comic vibes,
          and asked, “What if your subconscious had an interior design budget
          and a questionable sense of humour?”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="qa-pair">
        <h3>Q: WILL THERE BE A STORY BEYOND THE PUZZLES?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Of course. It’s hidden in the architecture, the recurring objects,
          and possibly behind that one suspicious couch in Level 4, Room 1 you
          never checked. Whether you figure it out or just start making wild
          guesses is entirely up to you.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="qa-pair">
        <h3>Q: WHY A MUSEUM?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Because nothing says “surreal” like wandering through a gallery of
          impossible nonsense. Also, museums have big rooms — perfect for
          shoving in massive props, giant portals, and physics violations
          without breaking too many building codes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="qa-pair">
        <h3>Q: WHAT’S WITH THE ALARM CLOCKS?</h3>
        <p>
          A: They’re there to remind you that you should wake up at some point…
          but also to make you wonder if you’re running late for something
          important. Or unimportant. Or maybe they’re just in on the joke.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="qa-pair">
        <h3>Q: IS THIS A HORROR GAME?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Only if you find optical illusions, shifting doors, and giant props
          terrifying.
